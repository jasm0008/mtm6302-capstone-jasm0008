Project that I chose chose: Quiz Site

The mockup decision is a simple design for a quiz website, I also brought many different screen sizes such as desktop, mobile & tablet. I have also implemented the learning we did in class such as the dark mode.


PROCEDURES:

Making this coding was challenging, which is understandable.

I had to make a lot of research for the help of my coding to be efficient

There is things that I've learned a lot while making this. It also had made me think how do they simply codings after productions

I had to make first an html, after that my index would be copied to all the other pages but with few changes

Writing the javascript part was really challanging, since we are not well familiar with it yet in the program

I had to run a lot of testings to see if things works the way I wanted

There are few things that are not working as I wished for it to work.
